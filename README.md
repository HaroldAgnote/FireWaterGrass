# FireWaterGrass

FireWaterGrass is a Android Mobile application that simulates a Rock, Paper, Scissors Game in a Pokemon Theme.

The concept of the game itself began as a School Project, but it evolved from a console application to a desktop application and to a mobile application.

The Mobile Application was started and finished at UC San Diego during the SDHacks Hackthon from September 30th to October 2nd.
